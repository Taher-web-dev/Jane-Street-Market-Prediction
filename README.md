In this project, we find two notebooks : 

- EDA + missing values + TSNE clustering+ class imb : In this notebook, we find the exploration datas analysis of our datas, then a modelisation using lgbm 

- lgbm multilabel : This notebook perform a modelisation of blended model between an lgbm multilabel model  and the model built in the first nootebook.  We should mention that this notebook allows us to take advanced place in this competition until the time i write theses lines. Indeed theses model will be tested in real datas for a period of 6 months. This nootebook allows to take a place of 15% rank , which equivalent to top 600 from about 5000 participants.
